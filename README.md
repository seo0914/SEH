Stereo Feature Learning based on Attention and Geometry for Absolute Hand Pose Estimation in Egocentric Stereo Views

* Our **SEH dataset** is the first hand pose dataset for egocentric stereo vision with **accurate GT 3D hand poses**.
* Our dataset includes three types of interactions : tapping, drawing, and toruch gestures. These interactions were performed on three backgrounds: white, wood, and cluttered.
