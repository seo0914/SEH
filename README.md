## Stereo Feature Learning based on Attention and Geometry for Absolute Hand Pose Estimation in Egocentric Stereo Views

## SEH  
* Our **SEH dataset** is the first hand pose dataset for egocentric stereo vision with **accurate GT 3D hand poses**.
* Our dataset includes **three types of interactions** : tapping, drawing, and toruch gestures. These interactions were performed on **three types of backgrounds**: white, wood, and cluttered.
